## Sleep Debt Calculator Project

Calculate if you're getting enough sleep each week.

## Overview

We are going to write a program that asks a user how many hours of sleep is ideal each night, then compare that to the actual hours they slept each night of the last week.

Then, we will calculate the amount of hours over or under they are to their sleep goal.
